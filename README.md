# Current-and-Past-Research-Projects

Example code:
contains MATLAB files for ray tracing alogirthms I have worked on. 

Example Images:
contains images that are results from the research I have done. There is one image of an example ray trace with a simple Gaussian shaped sea mount. There are also various images from the surface loading project I did, these show the displacements.

Project PDFs:
Contains disserations I have made on the projects I have done. IMPORTANT: the Gaussian beam tracing file is a relativly recent but unfinished draft of the progress I have made thus far.
