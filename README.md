# Current-and-Past-Research-Projects

**Example code:**
Contains MATLAB files for ray tracing alogirthms I have worked on. NOTE: these files have dependencies (not inclueded here) on other files relating to the generation of sound speed data. They will not work without these file. However, they can be found here http://staff.washington.edu/dushaw/ under misclaneous then under Sound Speed, Temperature, Salinity, and Buoyancy Profiles for the World Ocean from the 2001 World Ocean Atlas.

**Example Images:**
Contains images that are results from the research I have done. There is one image of an example ray trace with a simple Gaussian shaped sea mount. There are also various images from the surface loading project I did, these show the displacements.

**Project PDFs:**
Contains disserations I have made on the projects I have done. IMPORTANT: the Gaussian beam tracing file is a relativly recent but unfinished draft of the progress I have made thus far.
